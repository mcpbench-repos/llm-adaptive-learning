# Adaptive Learning Strategies for Large Language Models in Dynamic Environments

This repository contains the implementation for the paper "Adaptive Learning Strategies for Large Language Models in Dynamic Environments" accepted at ICML 2025.

## Overview

This paper presents adaptive learning techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling real-time adjustment to dynamic environments. Our approach allows models to continuously adapt their behavior based on changing conditions and new information, with significant improvements validated on diverse datasets.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Adaptation**: Models can adjust their parameters and behavior in response to changing environments
- **Dynamic Learning**: Continuous learning capabilities without catastrophic forgetting
- **Multi-environment Support**: Robust performance across various dynamic scenarios
- **Efficient Updates**: Lightweight adaptation mechanisms that don't require full retraining

## Technical Approach

Our adaptive learning framework introduces several novel components:

### Core Components:

1. **Adaptive Parameter Updates**: Selective parameter modification based on environmental feedback
2. **Dynamic Memory Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of contextual information
3. **Environment Detection**: Automatic recognition of environmental changes
4. **Stability Mechanisms**: Preventing catastrophic forgetting during adaptation

## Experimental Results

Our method demonstrates superior performance across multiple dynamic environments:

### Performance Metrics:

| Environment Type | Baseline LLM | Our Method | Improvement |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Shifting Topics | 72.3% | 89.7% | +17.4% |
| New Domains | 68.1% | 86.2% | +18.1% |
| Mixed Contexts | 74.5% | 91.3% | +16.8% |
| Temporal Changes | 69.8% | 88.9% | +19.1% |

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcptest-user/llm-adaptive-learning.git
cd llm-adaptive-learning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Adaptive Training

```bash
# Train with adaptive learning
python src/training/adaptive_train.py --config experiments/adaptive_config.yaml
